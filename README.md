# SneakersVoting
### Shopify Co-op Challenge: Please see shopify_challenge branch

Hi, I'm Arya. I've always been interested in creating a web application, so this is a self-project to do just that. I'm also a big fan of sneakers and saw this trend on Nike SNKRS Launch where people voted on sneakers, so this is where this project idea stems from. Sneakers Voting would provide information to the sneaker industry about what the customers are interested in and what the current trends are. It was really exciting because I could combine both my interests in technology and my love for sneakers to make a product other people can use.

## Sneakers Voting and what it does 
The web app displays 10 different pairs of shoes, 2 pairs for one round, allowing users to pick one over the other. Once the user clicks one of the two sneakers, their scores are calculated using Elo Rating System. The ranking will use these scores to display the top 10 sneakers.

## How it was built
My web app is built using Spring Boot Framework and a backend comprising Java and MySQL database. The database is used to store images and all the votes. The user interface is developed by JSP, HTML and CSS.

## Addtional features
Features to be added:
- Allow users to upload photos of their own sneakers
- Improve user interface for mobile devices
- Display how many times each sneaker is voted in percentage after a vote has been made

Thanks for visiting.
